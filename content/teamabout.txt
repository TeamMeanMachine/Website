FIRST Robotics Team 2471, Team Mean Machine, is based out of Camas, Washington.
We build robots to operate at competitions on the regional and national level. Our
current team membership totals at 27 students, and 15 mentors. We hold numerous
titles from our regional competitions in Portland, Seattle and the World Championships (if
qualified) in St.Louis. Students are selected for our team based on the same principle that
began the FIRST organization: their interest in science and technology! We are dedicated
to: safety in our work, innovation in our creations, excellence in our designs and gracious
professionalism within our community.

<br><br>

&quot;Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging
them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology
skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-
confidence, communication, and leadership.&quot; -FIRST

The team gives back to the community by doing numerous science, technology and robotic
related projects for the elementary schools and for the Parks and Recreation Group.

<br><br>

In addition to the technical aspect of the robots, students connect with various industry
sponsors and conducts team fundraisers to earn the finances required to support the
operation.

Recruiting takes place at many events where we demonstrate our past robots. Although
primary membership is from Camas High school, the team supports students from two other
schools in SW Washington, Hockinson and Washougal. As new students sign up, they are
invited to come to meetings where we work to find the specialty, or sub-team, that best
suits each student. The build team is usually divided into four sub-teams; programming/
electrical, chassis, manipulator and Public Relations/Media. Once a student has found an
area they particularly enjoy, the students work with the team&rsquo;s mentors and other students
in that area to advance their skills. Some students have a broad interest in many team
aspects and regularly move between different sub-teams. This is important because it
allows for better communication between the sub-teams and continuous updates on the
robot when in build session.

We meet at Liberty Middle School in Camas (see our Calendar for our next meeting). We
are always looking for help, be it as a student member, an adult mentor, or a sponsor.
Community members are also welcome to pay us a visit. So if you have any questions or
would just like to see what we're doing, come to one of our meetings to check it out or
email us at chsfirst@gmail.com.
